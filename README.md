## Installation

Download and install [NW.js v0.21.6 LTS](https://dl.nwjs.io/v0.21.6/) and [Node.js v7.9.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v7.9.0/).  These versions are recommended for easiest install but newer versions will work too.  If you already have another version of Node.js installed, you can use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to keep both.

Clone the source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/exodus/Exodus.git
cd Exodus
```



Install [bower](http://bower.io/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) if you haven't already:

```sh
npm install -g bower
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Build Exodus:

```sh
bower install
npm install
grunt
```
If you are on Windows or using NW.js and Node.js versions other than recommended, see [NW.js instructions about building native modules](http://docs.nwjs.io/en/latest/For%20Users/Advanced/Use%20Native%20Node%20Modules/).

After first run, you'll likely encounter runtime error complaining about node_sqlite3.node not being found, copy the file from the neighboring directory to where the program tries to find it, and run again. (e.g. from `Exodus/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/node-v51-darwin-x64` to `Exodus/node_modules/sqlite3/lib/binding/node-webkit-v0.21.6-darwin-x64`)

Then run Exodus desktop client:

```sh
/path/to/your/nwjs/nwjs .
```
